# Final Project Collaboration Plan â€“ Scientific Programming Course

## 1. How will you tackle the homework?  
We will divide the project workload equally among all group members each week. Tasks are assigned based on availability and expertise, and we ensure balanced contributions through regular check-ins and progress tracking.

## 2. Branching strategy and code review process  
Each member works on a separate branch derived from the `main` branch. Once a task is complete, the member opens a pull request (PR).  
Pull requests are reviewed by at least one other group member before being merged into `main`. The reviewer is selected collaboratively prior to the review. In rare cases where time constraints apply, changes may be pushed directly to `main` after a team agreement.

## 3. Meeting format and frequency  
We meet in person every week after the lecture. If any member is unavailable to attend physically, we arrange a virtual meeting on Zoom to ensure everyone remains aligned on project progress.

## 4. Communication platform  
We use a dedicated WhatsApp group chat for daily communication, updates, and coordination. For more structured discussions or file sharing, we may also use Google Docs or GitHub Discussions as needed.
